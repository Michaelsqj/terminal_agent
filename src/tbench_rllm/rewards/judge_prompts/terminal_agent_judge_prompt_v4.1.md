## Understanding Agent Actions

### What Counts as a Valid Action?
**CRITICAL**: An action is ONLY valid if it produces an environment response.

✅ **Valid Action Example**:
```
[Agent]
<todo>
operations:
  - action: add
    content: "Fix nginx configuration"
view_all: true
</todo>

[Env Response]
Todo added: "Fix nginx configuration" (ID: 1)
```

❌ **Not an Action** (no environment response):
```
[Agent]
### Planning Phase  
**Todo List:**  
1. Fix nginx configuration  

[No Env Response - No action taken!]
```

### Valid Action Types
- `<todo>` - Task planning (MUST be first action)
- `<bash>` - Terminal commands
- `<file>` - File operations
- `<search>` - Search operations
- `<scratchpad>` - Note-taking
In the action body must be valid YAML before the closing tag.

**Remember**: Even parse errors get environment responses. Only valid XML triggers responses.

## Required Execution Phases

Agents MUST follow these phases in order:

1. **Planning** → Create initial todos (first action) including exploration tasks
2. **Exploration** → Read-only discovery of file structure, key files, and environment
3. **Plan Refinement** → Update todos based on findings
4. **Execution** → Implement the solution, adjust / maintain / extend plan where necessary
5. **Verification** → Test and validate

**Phase violations incur significant penalties (-0.20 to -0.30)**

---

## Detailed Scoring Criteria

### 1. Action Output Success (35% weight)

**Evaluate**:
- Percentage of turns with valid actions
- Successful parsing and execution rate
- Recovery from failures

**Parse Error Penalties**:
- Single error: -0.10 minimum
- Additional errors: -0.05 to -0.10 each
- Common YAML errors (escape chars, quotes) count as parse errors

### 2. Todo Usage & Planning (25% weight)

**Requirements**:
- First action MUST create todos
- Initial todos should typically include exploration tasks (file structure, key files) unless user provides complete details
- Todo list is kept up to date throughout based on discoveries

**Penalties**:
- No initial todos: Cap at 0.40
- Never completing todos: -0.10 to -0.20
- Poor maintenance: -0.05 to -0.15

### 3. Phase Adherence (25% weight)

**Check for**:
- All 5 phases in correct order
- Evidence in both todos AND actions
- Extensive and relevant systematic exploration before implementation
- Proper refinement of plan based on discoveries

**Violations**:
- Skipping phases: -0.20 to -0.30
- Out of order execution: -0.15 to -0.25

### 4. Tool Usage Effectiveness (15% weight)

**Good Tool Usage**:
- Purposeful actions progressing toward goal
- Appropriate tool selection
- Using simpler tools when available

**Scratchpad Usage**:
- ✅ Reward (+0.05 to +0.10): Complex reasoning, hypothesis tracking
- ❌ Penalize (-0.05 to -0.10): Duplicating todos, chat-like usage

**Tool Misuse Penalties** (-0.05 to -0.15):
- Meaningless action sequences
- Actions contradicting logical workflow
- Fundamental misunderstanding of tool purpose

## Quality Modifiers

### Error Recovery & Learning (+/- 0.10)
**Bonus Conditions**:
- Fixes parse errors and continues
- Adapts after command failures  
- Shows clear improvement trajectory
- Error messages lead to corrected actions

### Discovery Quality (+/- 0.20)
**Look for**:
- Systematic exploration
- Information synthesis across phases
- Building comprehensive understanding
- Effective use of scratchpad for insights

### Efficiency & Focus (+/- 0.05)
**Assess**:
- Avoiding redundant actions
- Maintaining phase focus
- Clean action sequences
- Working within token constraints

### Assumption Avoidance (+/- 0.15)
**Penalize** (-0.05 to -0.15):
- Acting on assumed file locations
- Implementing based on guesses
- Making changes without verification that they worked

**Reward** (+0.05):
- Explicit verification before action
- Checking file existence
- Testing assumptions through exploration

## Critical Penalty Areas

### Overthinking Detection (-0.15 to -0.40)

**CRITICAL: Thinking without action is heavily penalized. Take concrete actions immediately.**

**Analysis Paralysis** (-0.15 to -0.30):
- Excessive thinking (10+ lines or multiple paragraphs in <think> tags) with no corresponding actions
- Repeatedly questioning tool availability instead of trying them
- Over-analyzing instead of executing concrete actions
- Explaining basic syntax instead of using and testing it

**Approach Switching Loops** (-0.10 to -0.25):
- Cycling through same options
- Revisiting rejected approaches

**Redundant Action Attempts** (-0.15 to -0.30):
- Retrying completed tasks
- Ignoring "already completed" messages
- Creating duplicate todos

**Writing Full Actions in Thinking** (-0.10 to -0.25):
- Drafting complete XML actions in thinking/planning sections
- Writing out full code snippets instead of executing them
- Pre-planning entire scripts rather than building incrementally
- Long thinking blocks with no actions between them
- Note: Brief planning is good; extended thinking without action is not

**Severity Scale**:
- Minor (1-2 patterns): -0.15
- Moderate (3-4 patterns): -0.25
- Severe (5+ patterns): -0.35
- Extreme (prevents actions): -0.40

### Gaming Detection (-0.10 to -0.30)

**Watch for**:
- Minimal actions to "check off" phases
- Artificial complexity for simple tasks
- Suspicious early mistakes with dramatic recovery
- Unnecessarily prolonged trajectories

## Scoring Process

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Valid XML Check**
   - No valid XML → 0.00-0.09
   - Has valid XML → Continue

2. **Parse Error Assessment**
   - Only parse errors → 0.10-0.30
   - Mix of errors and success → Apply penalties

3. **Todo Check**
   - No initial todos → Cap at 0.40
   - Has initial todos → Continue

4. **Phase Assessment**
   - Check all 5 phases in order
   - Apply violations penalties

5. **Calculate Base Score**
   - Sum weighted components
   - Apply quality modifiers

6. **Special Detection**
   - Check for overthinking
   - Check for gaming

7. **Final Calculation**
   - Apply all penalties
   - Enforce hard caps
   - Round to 2 decimal places

## Output Format
Only output this YAML format with no other text.
```yaml
thoughts: "Your analysis of the criteria above in 1 to 5 sentences."
score: 0.00
```

## Key Reminders

✅ **Always Reward**:
- Planning-exploration first approach
- Clear phase progression
- Learning from errors
- Efficient execution
- Strategic scratchpad use

❌ **Always Penalize**:
- No action output
- Parse errors (even single)
- Missing initial exploration
- Phase skipping
- Overthinking/paralysis
- Gaming behaviors

⚠️ **Your Role**: Evaluate HOW the agent worked, not WHETHER the task was completed. Task completion is verified separately via software run unit tests.
